# Reinforcement Learning Implementation

## Environment Design
The environment is implemented as an OpenAI Gym-compatible class:
```python
class GearEnv(gym.Env):
    def __init__(self):
        self.action_space = spaces.Box(low=-1.0, high=1.0, shape=(5,))
        self.observation_space = spaces.Box(low=-np.inf, high=np.inf, shape=(obs_size,))
    
    def reset(self):
        # Initialize with input/output gears
        return self._get_observation()
    
    def step(self, action):
        # Process action and update state
        return observation, reward, done, info
```

## Action Space
The agent controls:
1. **Action type**: 
   - 0: Place new gear
   - 1: Modify input gear teeth
   - 2: Modify output gear teeth
2. **Position**: (x, y) coordinates
3. **Gear parameters**: Teeth count and z-layer

## State Representation
The observation includes:
1. System parameters:
   - Target torque ratio
   - Input/output shaft positions
2. Gear parameters for up to MAX_GEARS:
   - Position (x, y)
   - Teeth count
   - z-layer

## Reward Function
The reward function is designed to guide the agent towards a valid and efficient gear system. It is a sum of several components:

`R_total = R_ratio + P_efficiency + R_connection`

### Reward Components
- **R_ratio**: An exponential reward for achieving a gear ratio close to the target.
- **P_efficiency**: A penalty for the number of gears used, encouraging simpler designs. This is controlled by the `P_GEAR_COUNT_PENALTY` hyperparameter.
- **R_connection**: A bonus awarded for successfully connecting the input and output shafts.
- **Other Penalties**: The environment also applies penalties for invalid actions, such as placing gears outside the boundary or causing collisions.

## Training Process
1. **Initialization**:
   ```python
   env = GearEnv()
   agent = PPOAgent(env)
   ```
2. **Training Loop**:
   ```python
   for timestep in total_timesteps:
        action = agent.select_action(state)
        next_state, reward, done = env.step(action)
        agent.store_transition(state, action, reward, next_state, done)
        agent.update()
   ```

## PPO Agent
```python
class PPOAgent:
    def __init__(self, env):
        self.policy = PolicyNetwork()
        self.value_net = ValueNetwork()
    
    def select_action(self, state):
        # Sample action from policy distribution
        return action, log_prob
    
    def update(self):
        # PPO optimization with clipping
        pass
